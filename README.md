# kop
kop is a cli tool that I personally use for daily CTF. 

**Concept: Do not type same commands**
  
If you are CTF player, you are probably typing same commands everyday, like `nmap <ipaddress>`, or `gobuster dir --urlã€€http://<ipaddress>`... and so on.  
The problem is that these commands slightly change every time, because of the "variable" factors, like IP address.

kop was made to address this problem. 


Here's a quick example usage.  
![image](https://github.com/0xsuk/kop/blob/main/.github/example.png)  
brief explanation:  
- `kop ac`: `ac` stands for "add command".   
Adding nmap command with IP variable.    
- `kop av`: `av` stands for "add variable".    
Setting IP variable to 10.11.12.13.
- `kop sc`: `sc` stands for "search command".   
Searching commands that contains string "nmap", and kop shows hit and its index (which is 0).   
- `kop cc`: `cc` stands for "copy command".   
Copying a command at index 0, to my **system clipboard**.  

and then the nmap command was copied to my clipboard, **replacing IP variable with its value.**

Commands and variables added by `ac` and `av`, will remain in json files, so you don't have to type them again.
